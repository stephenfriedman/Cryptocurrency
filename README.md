# The "I've Heard of Bitcoin And Kinda Wanna Invest But I Don't Know Anything" Guide

Nice. You've already made a step in the right direction towards your first Lamborghini. Alright, fine, you may not pan out from rags to 
riches but cryptocurrencys are at the very least an investment to consider. This guide is intended to help inform on the different types 
of cryptocurrencys, setting up wallets, choosing an exchange, and my own two cents.

Bitcoin is what you may be most familiar with but what you may not understand is how it differs from "Altcoins". Altcoin is just an 
encompassing term for pretty much any crypto that's not Bitcoin (Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, Dogecoin). As of 9/6/2017 [Coin Marketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/) is listing over 1,000 assets and currencies. What fundamentally differentiates each is 
generally its public ledger, transaction handling, and mission behind it. I will cover a few of the differences between some of the more 
popular cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto who envisioned replacing a trust based payment system via cryptographic proof and without the 
need of a third party (the government). The reason for this is that a decentralized currency can allow for anonymity and create a 
secure medium for individuals to exchange with one another (in a world where many people don't have access to basic banking). A currency 
not backed by a government *can* keep it free from regulation and puts the value of the currency into the hands of its holders, 
merchants, and maintainers of the network. However the most important piece is the public ledger technology that allows for any of this 
to work. Bitcoin relies on what is called a blockchain. In its essence, it publicly records to which wallets bitcoins move to and from. 
Other currencies implement their public ledgers differently with focuses on transaction resolution speed and volume, security, and what 
keeps its infrastructure publicly available 24/7.


What does not differ is that to hold any of these currencies, you need a digital wallet and a way to buy and sell them. A wallet is 
where one stores their cryptocurrencys. Some wallets can even hold multiple types. Wallets generally mean having a public address and a 
private key. The public address is what you share with others when you want to receive cryptocurrency. In other words, you can share 
your public key with others (and for many cryptocurrencys the public ledger makes your address public anyway). Your private key you 
should never share with anyone. It is your only way to have access to the currency in the wallet. Save both of your keys somewhere 
secure. Really secure. There are special USB drives you can buy to do this for you. If you lose your private key, then your currency 
will remain in your wallet until Kim Jong Un nukes us all.


## Cryptocurrencys
| Ticker | Symbol | Crypto   |
|:------:|--------|----------|
| BTC    | ฿      | Bitcoin  |
| ETH    | Ξ      | Ethereum | 
| XRP    | Ʀ      | Ripple   |
| MIOTA  | I      | Iota     |



### Bitcoin
This one was explained above. This is a mineable currency but not worth your time unless you're [firing up some ASICs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit). With the highest market cap of $75 billion and just under a 50% 
market share among all cryptocurrencys, it is safe to say this is the most popular of them all. While first to market may be a good 
reason to think it will remain on top, other cryptos have superior technologies that have stemmed off some of the basic principles of 
Bitcoin. Transactions were limited to 7 per second but that is rapidly changing with [SegWit](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/segwit-segregated-witness.asp) and other initiatives. Trading Bitcoin is very easy as virtually 
every exchange trades it. Your wallet is composed of a Bitcoin address, which is public and you share, and a private key that you use to 
access your Bitcoin. Websites like [Wallet Generator](https://walletgenerator.net/), [Brain Wallet](https://brainwallet.io/), and 
[Electum](https://electrum.org/#home) generate wallets that you can use. [Bitref](https://bitref.com/) can be used to check the balance of your wallet. Bitcoin does not need to be traded in whole bitcoins for a 
transaction.

### Ethereum
A [smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) public blockchain based token second to Bitcoin at $30 billion. Many 
other cryptocurrencys utilize Ethereum's smart contract technology. Ethereum functions as a smart contract environment that can be used 
in [DAPPS](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/dapps-the-decentralized-future/). Wallets can be easily made at [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/). Ethereum addresses are capable of holding Ethereum and other ERC20 based tokens. Ethereum is widely 
available and is listed on most exchanges. ERC20 tokens like [district0x](https://district0x.io/) and [OmiseGo](https://omg.omise.co/) leverage smart contracts in their applications.

| Tether | 0.000000000001      |


### Ripple
Developed with the intent of being a bank transaction settlement token, [Ripple](https://ripple.com/) is a pre-mined currency with a 
market cap of $8 billion. Some banks are currently utilizing and experimenting with Ripple's network but do not necessarily need to 
hold or use XRP to do so. The network is based on trusts set between users and the network confirms transactions via this chaining of 
trusts. Wallets need to hold a minimum of 15 XRP to help facilitate this network of trusts. They can be generated easily [here](https://ihomp.github.io/ripply-paper-wallet/coldwallet-SHA1-cdfbe3260927b6073180a1099f02ef99ce0495e8.html). Wallet balances and 
transaction history can be viewed on [Bithomp](https://bithomp.com/). XRP is traded on most major exchanges. 

> XRP as currently implemented has six digits of precision. The smallest unit is one millionth of an XRP ( 0.000001 ) and is called a 
"drop". That is: 1 XRP = 1,000,000 drops. -Wikipedia


### IOTA
A crypto focused on the Internet of Things (IoT). With transactions capable of up to 16 decimal places, micro transactions are possible 
which would be a necessity in supporting the envisioned future of IoT infrastructure . IOTAs "blockchain" is actually not a blockchain at all. Called the Tangle, the network becomes more secure with each confirmed transaction. The Tangle is also capable of rediculously fast transaction settlement speeds. It is still in its early phases and began trading on exchanges this past June. That said, it is not supported on many exchanges as of yet. Bitfinex currently carries it.  Wallets can be downloaded on [Github](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet/releases). [MWJ](https://matthewwinstonjohnson.gitbooks.io/iota-guide-and-faq/getting-started/dl-
wallet/what-is-my-seed.html) has a great guide on getting setup with the wallet and generating a seed.

## Exchanges
You will want to register with an exchange to buy and sell your cryptos. Note that you do not need to use an exchange to transfer 
currencies between wallets. Exchanges vary in the currencies that they trade. As of recently, since many exchanges are not in the US and 
legality is in limbo in tandem with an influx of trading volume, United States residents may be limited in their trading functionality. 
Security should always be a consideration when choosing an exchange. Keep this in mind if you want to transfer money from a bank account 
to one of these exchanges. Keep your tokens in your cold wallets and only move them into your exchange when you are making trades. You 
will not want to run the risk of losing money in an exchange wallet if the excahnge gets hacked or is seized by regulators. Registration will be required for most exchanges and this can include providing photo ID, SSN, a day of registration photo, name, and address. Reigstration approval can take days or weeks and with the *recent* spark in crypto interest, many exchanges are slow in dealing with the registration overload. You will be able to move the cryptos supported to and from your cold wallets and to other exchanges as well. They can charge fees for buying, selling, and transferring currencies.

Getting started likely means opening up an account with an exchange and wiring money from your bank account. You can expect to pay 
$15-$45 in wire transfer fees depending on your bank and if it's a domestic or international transfer. Each exchange lists their 
trading and withdrawal fees. Keep on the lookout for crypto news and exchange alerts because acting fast may be the key to saving your 
wallet's funds.

## Whitepapers

Whitepapers are the official documentation and outline of a cryptocurrency or its blockchain technology. They are generally written by 
the creators of the currencies and go into all of the technical details behind their technology. I advise giving these a read, at least 
the parts that explain their mission, to better get a sense of how their founders envision the use of their cryptocurrency and its 
underlying technology.
