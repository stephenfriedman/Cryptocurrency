# The "I've Heard of Bitcoin And Kinda Wanna Invest But I Don't Know Anything" Guide

Nice. You've already made a step in the right direction towards your first Lamborghini. Alright, fine, you may not pan out from rags to riches but cryptocurrencys are at the very least are an investment to consider. This guide is intended to help inform on the different types of cryptocurrencys, setting up wallets, choosing an exchange, and my own thoughts on the world with cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin is what you may be most familiar with but what you may not understand is how it differs from all of these "Altcoins". Altcoin is just an encompassing term for pretty much any crypto that's not Bitcoin (Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, Dogecoin). As of 9/6/2017 [Coin Marketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/) is listing over 1,000 assets and currencies. What fundamentally differentiates each from one another are generally its public ledger, transaction handling, and mission behind it. I will cover a few of the differences between some of the more popular crypto currencies here.

Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto who envisioned a currency that was not to be issued by a central governing agency. The reason for this is that a dencentralized currency can allow for anonymity and create a medium for individuals to exchange with one another (in a world where many people don't have access to basic banking). A currency not backed by a government *can* keep it free from regulation and puts the value of the currency into the hands of its users and maintainers of the network that support facilitating it's transactions. However the most important piece is the public ledger technology that allows for any of this to work. Bitcoin relies on what is called the blockchain. All it does is publicly record to which wallet addresses bitcoins move to and from. Other currencies implement their public ledger differently with focuses on transaction resolution speed and volume, security, and what keeps it's infrastructure publicly available 24/7.

What does not differ is that to hold any of these currencies, you need a digital wallet and a way to buy and sell them. A wallet is where one stores their crypto. Some wallets can even hold multiple types. Wallets generally mean having a public address and a private key. The public address is what you share with others when you want to receive crypto currency. In other words, you can share your public key with others (and for many cryptocurrencys the public ledger makes your address public anyway). Your private key you should never share with anyone. It is your only way to have access to the currency in the wallet. Save both of your keys somewhere safe. Really safe. There are special USB drives you can buy to do this for you. If you lose your private key, then your currency will remain in your wallet until Kim Jong Un nukes us all.

### Bitcoin
This one was explained above. This is a mineable currency but not worth your time unless your'e [firing up some Asics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit). With the highest market cap around $75 billion and just under a 50% market share among all cryptocurrencys, it is safe to say this is the most popular of them all. While first to market may be a good reason to think it will remain on top, other crptos have superior technologies that have stemmed off the some of the basic principles of Bitcoin. Transactions were limited to 7 per second but that it is rapidly changing with [SegWit](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/segwit-segregated-witness.asp) and other initiatives. Trading Bitcoin is very easy as virtually every excahnge trades it. Your wallet is composed of a Bitcoin address, which is public and you share,and a private key that you use to access your Bitcoin. Websites like [wallet generator](https://walletgenerator.net/), [brain wallet](https://brainwallet.io/), and [Electum](https://electrum.org/#home) generate wallets that you can use. Bitcoin does not need to be traded in whole bitcoins for a transaction.

### Ethereum
A [smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) public blockchain based token second to Bitcoin at $30 billion. Many other cryptocurrencys utilize Ethereum's smart contract technology. Ethereum functions as a smart contract environment that can be used in [DAPPS](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/dapps-the-decentralized-future/). Wallets can be easiy made at [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/). Ethereum addresses are capable of holding Ethereum and other ERC20 based tokens. Ethereum is widely available and is listed on most exchanges. Ethereum tokens like [district0x](https://district0x.io/) and [OmiseGo](https://omg.omise.co/) leverage smart contracts in their applications.
